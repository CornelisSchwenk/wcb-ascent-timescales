                 Summary and Brief Explanation of Scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **use_config.jl**
  - This script enhances the workflow in the Julia REPL. While useful, it is not 
    necessary for running the main analyses.

- **thermodynamic_functions.jl**
  - Contains functions for calculating various thermodynamical variables, such as 
    saturation vapor pressure.

- **statistical_functions.jl**
  - Implements custom statistical functions tailored for this analysis, including 
    methods for binning values into specified tau_600 bins.

- **icon_WCB_functions.jl**
  - Defines key data analysis functions related to WCB (Warm Conveyor Belt) trajectories. 
    This script creates global variables, including datasets for `WCB_tau_vars_normed.nc` 
    and generates masks for convective and slow trajectories. Most function names are 
    descriptive, such as `calc_DR`, which computes the Drying Ratio (DR). 
    Non-self-explanatory functions include descriptions within the code.

- **write_PECR.jl**
  - Writes a netCDF file containing important microphysical variables to the 
    `nest_data/` directory. The file is pre-populated to save time and computational 
    resources during later plotting.

- **functions_lin_interp.jl**
  - Defines functions for efficiently interpolating ICON data onto specified 
    latitude-longitude-pressure or latitude-longitude-height points. These functions 
    are primarily used for plotting data at pressure levels relevant to the case study.

- **calculate_mean_wind_shear.jl**
  - Calculates wind shear near trajectories during ascent. The script relies on 
    interpolated ICON output. It prints histogram values for plotting, although this part 
    may be somewhat messy since itâ€™s only used for one non-central plot in the appendix. 
    The calculation is triggered by the SLURM script located at 
    `EXECUTE_WIND_SHEAR_CALCULATION/do_calc_mean_wind_shear_mogon.slurm`.

- **pyplots.jl**
  - Creates plots that require `PyCall` and `Cartopy`. The plotting functions are 
    defined in this script, which also manages execution. Ensure to set the path to the 
    ICON output and the directory for ERA5 data (on model levels) before running:
    ```
    julia --project=. pyplots.jl
    ```

- **general_plot_functions.jl**
  - Contains uniform plotting functions used across various plots. This script is called 
    by the subsequent script that generates most of the paper's plots (excluding those 
    from `pyplots.jl`).

- **plot_functions.jl**
  - This script generates the majority of the plots presented in the paper, excluding 
    those created by `pyplots.jl`. It executes many functions defined in the previous 
    scripts. Note that running this script may require significant computational power 
    and time.
