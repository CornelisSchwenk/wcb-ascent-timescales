	In this folder you will find the scripts that take the trajectory 
	data created by ICON and prepare them for analysis.

	More info about the Lagrangian data output can be found in 
	merge_and_sum.sh

	If you want to run mogon_merge.sh then you HAVE to have a folder
	called "slurmfiles", otherwise it won't run. Mogon writes the 
	output and the errorfiles into this folder.
